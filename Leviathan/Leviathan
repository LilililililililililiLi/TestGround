  Monarchy detached from religious authority and became self-justified, signifying higher governing efficiency, centralization;

  //The primary nature of authority is not to maintain order out of chaos,but to maintain itself,
  //to show its subjects that it has the power to punish and for that sake, it has the ultimate
  //explanation to define what is punishable. Living under the supervision of authority doesn’t
  //always mean to be regulated by clearly established orders, for instead, orders could remain
  //vague and general. It is when the subject steps towards the grey area of the territory, the
  //unforeseeable threat of violence is projected upon one. Under this threatening suspension,
  //self censoring and mutual policing naturally happens among subjects. With such pressure,
  //one would constantly synchronize one’s behavior to the crowd, for the stance of the majority
  //presumably is not the “grey area”. While in fact, everyone is standing in the shade. One’s
  //expression is the crowd’s expressions, hence “faceless”. One’s demand never reaches further
  //than the minimum for the basic survival, hence “farm animals”.

Hyper-historical
A thought experiment: how would one define “history" ?
If the word “history” encompasses everything that happened in the past, then such notion can be pushed
towards the extreme as to everything I said, every sentence I just pronounced belongs to history - every instant
moment that can be articulated is a moment in the past. The transition from presence to past is also the
collapsing process of all possibilities into one cured, solidified circumstance. Through which one sees the
historical certainty and necessity, in the other side, there comes fate or inevitability of time. How would we
regard prophecy in this discourse ? The prophetic message must first come to past in order to come true.
Language is a debt collector, it collects history’s property.

Counter-historical : before the articulation
Does one have memory if one never recalls it? The act of recalling is to reconstruct the events in the past
every time when such action is called upon. One is situated in the every present moment for which one takes
as the zero point of coordinate and projects one’s consciousness into the past. The events that emerge from
the surface of the consciousness cannot be observed without the agency of consciousness itself.

The fact that we remember the past based on events instead of every single day is enough reason for us to
doubt the concreteness of the past. So here’s a question to people with good memory: why are you trying to
reconstruct an identical past every time you recall ? Does truth lie somewhere in the superpositions of all versions
of the construction ?

Self
We only see our forms when we encounter each other. Our forms are defined only on the fragment that is in focus.
Only at the moment of encountering, we realize that our subjectivities are our first imprisonment. Artist’s attention
is to re-create the cells of consciousness.
